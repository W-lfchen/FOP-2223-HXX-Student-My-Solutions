My solutions to the worksheets. Will post the points they yielded me.

Disclaimer: Cloning/forking this project will result in it not working as I am simply copying the main and test directories, all dependencies are missing.  
I might try to make it work at some point, but for now I have better things to do.

Notes: the .idea directory exists, I don't think anything of importance is in there. I use IntelliJ.  
As you might have  noticed, I am not very good at using markdown. My apologies, I will learn it at some point.  
I also might try to improve the solutions if I am bored. Whatever I upload initially should be what I turned in, but there might be somee censorship.  
All solutions get the maximum amount of points obtainable in the public tests.  
Starting from H07, I will try my best to add helpful comments and my responses to the voluntary questions ("Unbewertete Verst√§ndnisfragen") using comments.  
I might take the time to do this with the older worksheets as well, should I find myself with enough spare time.
